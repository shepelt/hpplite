/*
** HPPLite - Verifiable SQLite
**
** Tracks every write made through a connection, batches the SQL, and posts
** the batches to an L1 contract for data availability. Anyone can rebuild
** the database from L1 alone and check the resulting state root.
**
** The local database file is the only durable state HPPLite keeps:
**
**   _hpplite_pending  SQL captured by the statement trace. The row is written
**                     from inside the user's own statement, so it commits or
**                     rolls back together with the user's transaction. Rows
**                     are deleted once the batch they belong to is confirmed.
**   _hpplite_meta     Next batch height, previous block hash, the state root
**                     after the last confirmed batch, and checkpoint tracking.
**
** The state root is a content hash of all user tables (schema + rows). It is a
** function of the file, not of the path taken to produce it, so it can be
** recomputed at any time and compared against what was posted to L1.
